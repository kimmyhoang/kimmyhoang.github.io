				Switching Majors
            </h3>
            <p>
            Switched to mechatronics from another program. From studying economics to thermodynamics, 2 questions I get asked:
            </p>

            <blockquote>| I'm thinking of switching my major, advice?</blockquote>
            <p> 
                Having met many transfer students now, everyone has different reasons for their switch. Feel free 
                to <a href="mailto:k32hoang@uwaterloo.ca">contact</a> me, would love to help. Knowing what is pushing you out of your current program 
                and what is pulling you towards another program is useful.

            <p>
                I was in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/management-engineering" target="_blank">management engineering</a> before switching 
                to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering" target="_blank">mechatronics engineering</a>. 
                In short, mechatronics is cooler to me.

                The longer story, I had no exposure to robotics or much STEM at all in high school, coming from a small town. I struggled through 1st year 
                and was below class average, but worked hard and had the top grade average by 2nd year. Loved management engineering, but I decided to 
                take a course from mechatronics and learned there was so much cool stuff I didn't know existed. A huge thanks 
                to the mechatronics engineering director and advisors for helping me make the leap.
